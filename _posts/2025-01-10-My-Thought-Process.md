Whether we’re developing a new product or feature, I like to think of everyone, especially those fortunate enough to be young, able-bodied, and free from disabilities—which is often the largest group of people developers typically focus on. However, I believe our vision should also extend to those who aren’t as fortunate, such as those with visual impairments or mobility issues. We need to consider everyone while brainstorming for new features or products.

For instance, consider food delivery apps. We all use them, but many users don’t have specific health issues like diabetes or celiac disease. Yet, most restaurants don’t disclose their dietary measurements. As someone with celiac disease who can’t have gluten or rye, knowing that a dish is gluten-free would make my life much easier. Eating out or ordering food isn’t a privilege for able-bodied, disease-free people. Those with dietary restrictions and life-threatening health issues should also be considered.

Some might argue, “Why don’t they just cook at home instead of expecting restaurants to cook gluten-free food for customers?” Not everyone has the capability to cook, whether it’s due to lack of skills or physical limitations they don’t have to disclose. Restaurants should be able to serve everyone, and “everyone” doesn’t just include disease-free, able-bodied people.

In my thinking process, I often remind myself, “Accessibility is not a privilege.” It’s not yet treated as such, so I like to consider everyone’s needs.
